This expiration ensures that all officials and trainers are held accountable to the most current standards in boxing safety, rules, and officiating procedures. Failure to renew your certification by January 1st of the following year will result in the immediate suspension of your certification and official status within BoxSafe programs, including but not limited to, officiating, coaching, and working in any certified role.<\/p>\n\n        <p>By renewing your certification, you commit to staying informed and trained on the most recent developments, updates, and safety practices that have emerged throughout the year. This renewal process is crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of the sport, as well as ensuring that all officials continue to operate at the highest level of competency. Officials will not be permitted to participate in any events or roles until the renewal process is completed, and their certification status is restored.<\/p>\n\n        <h2>Conditions of Use<\/h2>\n        <p>By accessing and using this website, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to comply with the terms outlined in this Agreement.
